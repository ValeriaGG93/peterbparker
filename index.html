<h2> My life </h2>
<p> I saved the world a bunch of times. I got married. <br> Then divorced. <br> But that's okay because MJ gave me another chance. <br> Now I get together with a bunch of "retired" super friends once a week to workout and <s>
	cry</s> talk. <br> We accept walk-ins </p>

<h2> Is there life after the superhero gig?</h2>
<h3> I sure hope so </h3>
<h2> Things retired superheroes can do:</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Work on kids' parties (but only if you really like kids)</li>
	<li> Be a personal trainer (the pay is good)</li>
	<li> Train a bunch of versions of yourself from other universes (HIGHLY recommended!) </li> 
</ul>
<p> It certainly isn't easy to be a former superhero, but I'm learning that there's more than one way to save the world </p>
